# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository. Please follow these steps if you're interested in making contributions:

1. Please familiarize yourself with the [process of running the example app](https://github.com/Jungle-Works/flutter-flightmap-sdk-example-app) and [add a FlightMap access token](https://github.com/Jungle-Works/flutter-flightmap-sdk) as described in the Readme. 
2. Ensure that existing [pull requests](https://github.com/Jungle-Works/flutter-flightmap-sdk) and [issues](https://github.com/Jungle-Works/flutter-flightmap-sdk) don’t already cover your contribution or question.

3. Create a new branch that will contain your contributed code. Along with your contribution you should also adapt the example app to showcase any new features or APIs you have developed. This also makes testing your contribution much easier. Eventually create a pull request once you're done making changes.

4. If there are any changes that developers should be aware of, please update the [changelog](https://github.com/Jungle-Works/flutter-flightmap-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) once your pull request has been merged to the `master` branch.
